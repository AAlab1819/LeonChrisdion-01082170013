[[**problem**]](http://codeforces.com/contest/469/problem/A) [[**answer**]](http://codeforces.com/contest/469/submission/43018126)

For this problem it is written that we need to output the Little X and Y could pass  the whole game or not. First we need to input 
the integer of the maximum level of the game, and then we need to input the level that they should pass. If they can pass all level,
we need to output "I become the guy". If they can't pass all level, we need to ouput "Oh, my keyboard!".

In this problem we need to use the set library to save the data of each completed level. After the completed level was inputed, it
will be automatically inputed to the set.

Complexity:

Average case: O(n^2)
Best case: O(log n)
